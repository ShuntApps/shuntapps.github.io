<h1>Introduction to Python Programming</h1>
<div>This site is designed to help you in your journey through programming and is specifically aligned to a number of course and school’s introductory requirements.
Attempt tasks in sequence, don’t try to skip them and don’t just copy and paste from this site. For one writing it out yourself helps you to remember, for another it’s likely you’ll get weird formatting issues.
Programming is hard at first, don’t be afraid to ask for help, the internet will help but talk to peers or others to ask for help before reaching out. Try to think clearly about what the problem is, you’re not stuck and can’t do anything, what is going wrong? 
Make sure that you save your solutions in a Python Practice folder using appropriate names so you can go back to them, this means you can look at the programs that you have completed in previous lessons for help if you struggle.
Python is a nice language in many ways but it can have some tricks and programming in general can have a lot to remember, don’t think you need to remember everything, don't expect to remember it straighta away. Practice.

<br><h2>What is Programming?</h2>
<div>For many people programming is a mystery, programming is all about instructing a computer how to do something, but if computers are stupid we need to be clever, we need to be clear and think carefully about what we want and how we instruct something to do it, those instructions must be clear. If I tell you to jump for instance, most of you are probably sitting down, you’d likely need to stand and make sure there’s space. Computers wouldn’t- they’d just jump where they are- or more likely try to and fail.
    There are four aspects of computational thinking, decomposition, abstraction, pattern recognition and algorithms. 
    Decomposition
    involves breaking down a complex problem or system into smaller parts that are more manageable and easier to understand.
    Abstraction
    Abstraction is the process of filtering out the things that we don't need in order to concentrate on those that we do. It is also the filtering out of specific details. From this we create a representation of what we are trying to solve.
    Pattern recognition
    Involves finding the similarities or patterns among small, decomposed problems that can help us solve more complex problems more efficiently.
    Algorithms
    Is all about sequencing instructions or processes to solve a problem. Algorithms are throughout this book.
    Any programming involves algorithms, an algorithm is a list of rules to follow in order to solve a problem. Algorithms need to have their steps in the right order.  Think about an algorithm for getting dressed in the morning. What if you put on your jeans before your underwear. It’s not just the instructions it’s the order of them.
    You must be very specific, imagine an algorithm for making toast, it might contain “Put the butter on the bread” and the computer would put the butter tub on the bread
    You need to be precise and specific likewise “put the bread in the toaster” doesn’t turn it on, or specify how it goes in the toaster.

<h2>Starting out</h2>
<div>The examples contained within are built using Python 3.8 but should work with others too.
    Before you start, you’ll need a few things. 
    First is Python- this is the actual language runtime itself, the thing that allows you to run python programs. We’re using 3.8 but the newest should work fine.
    You may already have it, but to be safe download it from here https://www.python.org/downloads/
    Second is an IDE- an integrated developer environment, technically we could just use notepad but these have tools to help us write, organise, test and run code.
    The two most popular are Pycharm and Visual Studio Code, they have different setups so just follow the links here.
    Pycharm (either community or edu)

    Visual Studio Code
